# stock-price-prediction

## Project Description
This web app will be used by everyday investors who have a limited understanding of the technical and fundamental factors affecting blue chip stock prices. Our system will provide detailed insights into commonly used analysis models—such as discounted cash flow (DCF)in order to predict a stock's future price. We will differentiate our service from competitors’ offerings by providing users with transparents metrics that explain how we derive our projections. Our goal is to help users make better-informed decisions with their investments.

We will store user login credentials, user watch lists, and historical stock data in our databases. Users will have access to processed data generated by running mathematical models over the raw data that is stored in the database. If time permits, we aim to make these models more sophisticated.
